## Camera placement recommendations and scenarios

You need to consider three things when deciding how to install a camera:

- Camera height

- Camera-to-focal-point distance 

- The angle of the camera relative to the floor plane

### Camera-to-focal-point distance

Camera-to-focal-point distance is the linear distance from the focal point (or center focal point of the point of interest) to the 
camera. This distance is measured on the floor plane.

### Person walking direction
 
This is direction that the majority of people walk in relation to the camera field of view, or the direction that customers face when 
standing in line. This direction is important for system performance.

## Scenarios

The main scenarios for camera placement include the following zones:

- End caps (to determine display effectiveness)

- Queues

- Entrances

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone and the way customers and the environment interact with that 
zone.

### End caps

For end cap cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do customers face?

- Which direction do customers go to and from relative to the end cap?

- Where do customers stand to engage with the end cap?

- Where do customers pass by the end cap?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

### Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form, and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

### Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot 
traffic?

- Which direction do customers travel after entering the store?

- How will lighting outside the store affect viewing quality?

- What are the local rules and regulations regarding privacy?
