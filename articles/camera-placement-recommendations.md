# Camera placement recommendations for Dynamics 365 Connected Store

You need to consider three things when deciding how to install a camera:

- Camera height

- Camera-to-focal-point distance 

- The angle of the camera relative to the floor plane

## Camera-to-focal-point distance

Camera-to-focal-point distance is the linear distance from the focal point (or center focal point of the point of interest) to the 
camera. This distance is measured on the floor plane.

This is direction that the majority of people walk in relation to the camera field of view, or the direction that customers face when 
standing in line. This direction is important for system performance.
