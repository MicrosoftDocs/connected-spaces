# Camera placement recommendations for Dynamics 365 Connected Store

You need to consider three things when deciding how to install a camera for Dynamics 365 Connected Store:

- Camera height

- Camera-to-focal-point distance 

- The angle of the camera relative to the floor plane

*Camera-to-focal-point distance* is the linear distance from the focal point (or center focal point of the point of interest) to the 
camera. This distance is measured on the floor plane.

It's also important to know when direction the majority of people walk in relation to the camera field of view, or the direction that customers face when standing in line. This direction is important for system performance.

## Camera height

Generally, cameras should be mounted 12-14 feet from the ground. When planning your camera mounting in this range, 
consider the obstructions (for example, shelving, hanging lights, hanging signage, and displays) that might affect the 
camera view, and then adjust the height as necessary. 

## Camera-to-focal-point distance recommendations 

Use the table below to determine the camera’s distance from the focal point based on specific mounting heights. 
These distances are for optimal placement and are suitable for end caps (display effectiveness), queues, or entrances. 
Note that the table provides guidance below the 12-14’ recommendation since some store ceilings are limited in height.

|Camera height|Camera-to-focal-point distance (min/max)|
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
|8’	|10’-13’|
|10’|7’-13’|
|12’|10’-17’|
|14’|11’-18’|
|16’|12’-22’|
|20’|15’-30’|

The following illustration simulates camera views from the closest and farthest camera-to-focal-point distances.

## Camera angle mounting ranges

This section describes acceptable camera angle mounting ranges for store entrances, queues, and end caps. These mounting ranges show 
the acceptable range from optimal placement.

### Store entrances

The following table shows recommendations for store entrances.

|Camera height|Camera-to-focal-point distance|Acceptable camera mounting angle (min/max)|
|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|8’ |9’| +/-40°|
|10’|10’|+/-30°|
|12’|13’|+/-20°|
|16’|18’|+/-10°|
|20’|22’|+/-10°|

The following illustration simulates camera views using the leftmost (-) and rightmost (+) mounting angle recommendations.

### End caps

We recommend that you place cameras at 10 feet or more above ground to guarantee the covered area is big enough. Mount end-cap 
cameras in the specified distance from the target within the acceptable 120-degree angle range as shown in the following illustration.

### Queues

For optimal Queue data quality, retractable belt barriers are preferred (see image below). This type of barrier is preferred over 
opaque barriers for queue formation.

There are two types of queues: linear and zig-zag.

The following illustration shows recommendations for linear queues:

The following illustration provides simulations for left and right camera views for linear queues. Note that you can mount the camera 
on the opposite side of the queue.

For zip-zag queues, it’s best to avoid placing the camera directly facing the queue line direction, as shown in the 
following illustration. Note that each of the four example camera positions in the illustration provide the ideal view with an 
acceptable deviation of +/- 15 degrees in each direction.

#### Fixture (shelving) queues

Fixture queue lines use shelving to guide shoppers and to enable impulse buying.

This style of queue formation restricts the camera’s view of customers because it blocks customers from the waist down. 
To ensure the highest quality data, mount the cameras to avoid the shelving as much as possible and capture a complete view of 
customers.

#### Organic queue lines

Organic queue lines form organically from the point of sale. This style of queue is acceptable if customer queues don’t form 
beyond 2-3 people and the line forms within the zone definition. If the queue length is typically more than 2-3 people, we recommend 
using a retractable belt barrier to help guide the queue direction and ensure the line forms and dwells within the zone definition.
