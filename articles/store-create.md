[!INCLUDE[banner](includes/banner.md)]

After you [prepare your network and install Azure Stack Edge Pro (2 GPU)](ase-install.md), youâ€™re ready to create a store with the 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview web app. 

## Create a store

When you sign in to Connected Spaces with your admin credentials, the **Set up my store** page automatically appears.

On the **Set up my store** page:

1. In the **Store name** field, enter a friendly name for your store.

2. In the **Maximum occupancy** field, set the total store capacity. This is the total number of people across all entrances at one time. 

3. In the **Time zone** field, set the time zone for your store.

4. Fill in the **Address** and **City** fields with the address for your store.

5. In the **Country/Region** field, select the appropriate country/region.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must select a value in the **Country/Region** field to enable the **State** field.

6. In the **State** field, enter the state for your store. 

7. Select **Next**.

8. Make sure all the store details are correct, and then select **Create store**.
