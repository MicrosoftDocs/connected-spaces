Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview brings together computer vision and AI to help transform the physical space experience. By utilizing data from video cameras, Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces delivers real-time actionable recommendations that can make operations more efficient and improve customer experiences. 

Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces enables you to:

- **React to environmental triggers.** Ensure that customer needs are met effectively and quickly by equipping space managers and employees with actionable alerts triggered by store activity, such as long queues. Access to automated, sensor-driven reporting is standardized and available in-the-moment for immediate action.

- **Understand and optimize your space.** Take advantage of dashboards that inform you on the status of your space and the change that occurs within it. Optimize staffing and layout decisions using AI-driven insights around behavior in your space on any given day and time. 

- **Empower long-term decision making.** Predict the ideal future behaviors as your environment status changes over time. Make your insights stronger with each passing day.

## Scenarios

The preview release enables the following scenarios to make retail store operations more efficient and improve customer experiences: 

- **Area.** Create the real-world equivalent of the digital engagement funnel for areas of interest. This capability allows space managers to measure the effectiveness of areas of interest, such as promotions/displays, break rooms, lobbies, and tracking people entries and engagement.  

- **Queue.** Monitor queue wait time and queue lengths to improve customer experience and provide informed insights for employee shift management. 

- **Entries.** Understand entrance patterns into your space to help plan for shift management and/or inventory. 

Microsoft is committed to [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr6). These scenarios are powered by an innovative computer vision technology for people counting and dwell time measurement without individual shoppers being identified or having their facial characteristics analyzed.
