# Set your operating hours in Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview)

You can use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) web app to set your operating hours. If you don't set your operating hours, by default, the Connected Store dashboards will show 24/7 data, which would include after-hours time set aside for cleaning and restocking.

1. In the web app, select the appropriate store.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Settings**.

2. On the **Store** tab, in the **Operating Hours** field, enter your hours of operation.

    > If you change any settings for the Contoso Sample Store, they'll affect settings in other stores so we recommend that you not change settings for the sample store.
