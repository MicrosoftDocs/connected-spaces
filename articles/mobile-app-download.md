# Download the Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app

Keep the following in mind before using the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app:

- Make sure that your cameras, network, and Azure Stack Edge Pro (2 GPU) have been installed for your store. 

   You’ll use the mobile app to complete the activation and pairing of the gateway. Learn how to [prepare your network and install 
   Azure Stack Edge Pro](ase-install.md).
   
- To sign in to the app, you’ll need the right permissions linked to your account. If you need help, check with your account admin.

- You can install the app on multiple devices (iOS and Android). Whichever device you use, make sure to keep it up-to date-to get the 
latest experience, security, and bug fixes.

> [!NOTE]
> The Connected Store mobile app will also run on new Apple silicon-based devices. Microsoft has not validated full compatibility for the preview release.
