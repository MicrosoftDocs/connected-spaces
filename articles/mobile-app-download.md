   Azure Stack Edge Pro](ase-install.md).
   
- To sign in to the app, you’ll need the right permissions linked to your account. If you need help, check with your account admin.

- You can install the app on multiple Apple iPhones. Whichever iPhone you use, make sure to keep it up-to date-to get the 
latest experience, security, and bug fixes.
