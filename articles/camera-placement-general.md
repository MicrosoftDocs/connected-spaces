## General guidelines and scenarios for placing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store

Consider the following when positioning cameras:

- **Lighting height.** Place cameras below lighting fixtures so the fixtures donâ€™t block the cameras.

- **Obstructions.** To avoid obstructing camera views take note of obstructions such as poles, signage, shelving, walls, and existing 
LP cameras.

- **Environmental backlighting.** Outdoor backlighting affects camera image quality. To avoid severe backlighting conditions, 
avoid directing cameras at external-facing windows and glass doors.

- **Local privacy rules and regulations.** Local regulations may restrict what cameras capture outside store boundaries 
(through windows or doors). Make sure that you understand local rules and regulations before placing cameras that have a view of 
the outside.

- **Store changes.** Product displays and end caps may get moved after placing cameras. Make sure that camera placement is 
optimized for potential store changes to reduce camera re-positioning.

- **Building structure.** HVAC, sprinklers, and existing wiring may limit hard mounting of cameras.

- **Cable management.** Make sure you can route ethernet cable from planned camera mounting locations to the Power Over Internet 
(PoE) switch.
