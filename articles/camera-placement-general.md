# Scenarios for placing cameras to use with Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

[!INCLUDE [end-of-life](includes/end-of-life.md)]

The main scenarios for camera placement in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview include the following zones:

- Area
- Queue
- Entries

The following table provides more detail on the three available skills.

|Skill|Description|Examples|
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|**Area**|	Track how your areas of interest, such as a display, perform through dwell time |End caps, displays, promotions, breakrooms, lobbies, kiosk|
|**Queue**| 	Monitor queue wait time, length, and abandonment rate|	Queues, checkouts, returns|
|**Entries**|	Understand traffic patterns into your space|	Full space entry/exit|

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone, the way customers interact with the zone, and how environmental factors impact that zone.

## Area

For area of engagement cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do people go to and from relative to the area of interest?

- Where do people stand to engage with the area of interest?

- Where do people pass by the area of interest?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

## Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

## Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot traffic?

- Which direction do people travel after entering the space?

- How will lighting outside the space affect viewing quality?
