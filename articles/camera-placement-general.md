# General guidelines and scenarios for placing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store



## Scenarios

The main scenarios for camera placement include the following zones:

- End caps (to determine display effectiveness)

- Queues

- Entrances

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone and the way customers and the environment interact with that zone.

## End caps

For end cap cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do customers face?

- Which direction do customers go to and from relative to the end cap?

- Where do customers stand to engage with the end cap?

- Where do customers pass by the end cap?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

## Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form, and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

## Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot traffic?

- Which direction do customers travel after entering the store?

- How will lighting outside the store affect viewing quality?

- What are the local rules and regulations regarding privacy?
