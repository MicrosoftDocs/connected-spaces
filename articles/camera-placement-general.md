# Scenarios for placing cameras to use with Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

The main scenarios for camera placement in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview include the following zones:

- End caps (Display effectiveness skill)

- Queues (Queue management skill)

- Entrances (Shopper analytics skill)

The following table provides more detail on the three available skills.

|Skill|Description|Examples|
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|**Display effectiveness**|	Track how your displays perform	through foot traffic|End caps, displays, promotions|
|**Queue management**| 	Monitor queue wait time, length, and abandonment rate|	Queues, checkouts, returns|
|**Shopper analytics**|	Understand traffic patterns into and around the store|	Store entry/exit|

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone, the way customers interact with the zone, and how environmental factors impact that zone.

## End caps

For end cap cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do customers go to and from relative to the end cap?

- Where do customers stand to engage with the end cap?

- Where do customers pass by the end cap?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

## Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

## Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot traffic?

- Which direction do customers travel after entering the store?

- How will lighting outside the store affect viewing quality?
