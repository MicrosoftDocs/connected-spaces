# Scenarios for placing cameras to use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview)

The main scenarios for camera placement in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) include the following zones:

- End caps (**Display effectiveness** skill zone)

- Queues (**Queue management** skill zone)

- Entrances (**Shopper analytics** skill zone)

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone and the way customers and the environment interact with that zone.

## End caps

For end cap cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do customers face?

- Which direction do customers go to and from relative to the end cap?

- Where do customers stand to engage with the end cap?

- Where do customers pass by the end cap?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

## Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form, and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

## Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the cameraâ€™s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot traffic?

- Which direction do customers travel after entering the store?

- How will lighting outside the store affect viewing quality?

- What are the local rules and regulations regarding privacy?
