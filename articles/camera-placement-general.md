# General guidelines and scenarios for placing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store

Consider the following when positioning cameras:

- **Lighting height.** Place cameras below lighting fixtures so the fixtures don’t block the cameras.

- **Obstructions.** To avoid obstructing camera views take note of obstructions such as poles, signage, shelving, walls, and existing 
LP cameras.

- **Environmental backlighting.** Outdoor backlighting affects camera image quality. To avoid severe backlighting conditions, 
avoid directing cameras at external-facing windows and glass doors.

- **Local privacy rules and regulations.** Local regulations may restrict what cameras capture outside store boundaries 
(through windows or doors). Make sure that you understand local rules and regulations before placing cameras that have a view of 
the outside.

- **Store changes.** Product displays and end caps may get moved after placing cameras. Make sure that camera placement is 
optimized for potential store changes to reduce camera re-positioning.

- **Building structure.** HVAC, sprinklers, and existing wiring may limit hard mounting of cameras.

- **Cable management.** Make sure you can route ethernet cable from planned camera mounting locations to the Power Over Internet 
(PoE) switch.

## Scenarios

The main scenarios for camera placement include the following zones:

- End caps (to determine display effectiveness)

- Queues

- Entrances

To plan for the scenarios in your space, you need to understand each zone and the way customers and the environment interact with that zone.

## End caps

For end cap cameras, consider the following:

- Which direction do customers face?

- Which direction do customers go to and from relative to the end cap?

- Where do customers stand to engage with the end cap?

- Where do customers pass by the end cap?

- What is the height of nearby shelving or obstructions?

## Queues

For queue cameras, consider the following:

- Is the queue defined with shelving, barriers, or ropes? 

- If undefined, where does the queue typically form, and which direction(s) does it go during busy times?

- How long is the queue and what direction does the line form?

## Entrances

For entrance cameras, consider the following:

- What is the entrance width? Will the camera’s field of view (FOV) limitations require two or more cameras to capture entrance foot traffic?

- Which direction do customers travel after entering the store?

- How will lighting outside the store affect viewing quality?

- What are the local rules and regulations regarding privacy?
