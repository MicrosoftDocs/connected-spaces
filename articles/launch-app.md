To switch from the Contoso Sample Store to your own store, select the down arrow next to **Contoso sample store**, and then select your store from the list. 
This assumes you have already [set up the Azure Stack Edge gateway](admin-ase-setup.md) (required for installing cameras) and [created a store with the 
Connected Store mobile app](mobile-app-create-store.md).

If you haven't already set up Azure Stack Edge or created a store using the Connected Store mobile app, select **My store** in the list. You'll see the following 
page with links that help you with these tasks. 

To get back to the Contoso Sample Store from your store page, select the down arrow next to **Create a store**, and then select **Contoso Sample Store** from the 
list.
