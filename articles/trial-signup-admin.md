# Obtain and assign a viral license to enable users to sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

Anyone can [sign up for a free trial of Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview](trial-signup.md). Some companies restrict employees from using work email to sign up for trials, however. If that’s true  for your company, a user will see the following message when they try to sign up for the free trial.
