# Requirements for using the Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app

You can use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app on Apple iPhones running iOS 9.0 or later. [Find the software version of your iPhone, iPad, or iPod](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685). Using the app on an older iPhone that doesn’t meet the operating system requirements may cause compatibility issues. If you have any problems with the app, make sure that your operating system is up-to-date.

> [!NOTE]
> You can’t use the mobile app on an iPad or Android devices at this time.
