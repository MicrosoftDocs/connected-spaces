# Requirements for using the Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app

You can use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app on Apple iPhones running iOS 9.0 or later. [Learn how to find the software version of your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685). Using the app on an older iPhone may cause compatibility issues. If you have any problems with the app, make sure that your operating system is up-to-date.

To use the mobile app, you also need to have the **Connected Store Admin** user role. For more information, see [Give permissions to users](admin-user-accounts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You canâ€™t use the mobile app on an iPad or on Android devices at this time.
