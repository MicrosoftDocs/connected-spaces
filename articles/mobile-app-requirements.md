# Requirements for using the Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) mobile app

You can use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) on the devices/operating systems shown in the following table.

|Device|Operating system|
|----------------|-----------------|
|Apple iPhone or iPad|iOS 9.0 or later. [Find the version for your device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685).|
|Android phone or tablet|Android 4.1 or later. [Find the version for your device](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en).|

Using the app on an older operating system may cause compatibility issues. If you have any problems with the app, make sure that your operating system is up-to-date.

> To use the mobile app, you also need to have the **Connected Store Admin** user role. For more information, see [Give permissions to users](admin-user-accounts.md).
