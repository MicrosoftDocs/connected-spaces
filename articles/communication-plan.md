# Communicating with your shoppers about the use of Dynamics 365 Connected Store 

While shoppers may understand the use of cameras in retail spaces for security purposes, using cameras for other purposes can raise concerns about how personal data is protected, potentially impacting trust in your brand. 

To help shoppers understand your store’s approach to data privacy, you can create a **disclosure strategy**. A disclosure strategy will help you decide what information to communicate to shoppers as well as when and where to share it. 

This article offers best practices for creating and implementing a disclosure strategy for Microosft Dynamics 365 Connected Store based on insights from user research and Microsoft’s [Responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr6). It also includes design tips and examples for disclosure materials, which you can adapt to your context.  

> [!NOTE]
> This article includes best practices that may not align with laws and notice and disclosure regulations applicable to your store. It also does not consider your other data processing practices beyond your use of Connected Store. It is your responsibility to align your disclosure strategy with applicable legal requirements in your jurisdiction and accurately reflect all of your data collection and processing practices. See [Compliance and responsible use](compliance.md) for details.  

## What to disclose

What you choose to disclose to shoppers will depend on the unique context of your store and the range of technologies that you use.

Dynamics 365 Connected Store as a standalone technology is considered low sensitivity in part because it does not store personally identifiable information. For low-sensitivity scenarios, a disclosure strategy can build trust by helping shoppers understand: (1) That a technology is in use; (2) What that technology does; (3) How personal data is protected.

Specifically, we recommend providing shoppers with answers to the following questions:

- What technology is in use, when is it in use, and how does it work?   

- How do shoppers benefit?

- What information is collected and how is it used?

- What information is not collected?

- How is personal data protected?

- Who has access to data?

- How long is data stored?

- What information is shared with other companies?

- Can individuals opt out?

For information on how Dynamics 365 Connected Store works and how personal data is protected, see:

- [AI and insights](ai-insights.md)

- [Data and privacy](data-privacy.md)

The best practices in this guide do not consider how your store may use personal data outside of the data provided to Microsoft through your use of Dynamics 365 Connected Store. Therefore, consider your store’s unique context: 

- **Do you use other technology during the shopping experience that does collect or store personal data?** If so, answers to the previous questions will be different than if your store only uses Dynamics 365 Connected Store. In this case, consider a unified disclosure strategy that covers all parts of your technology ecosystem that may affect shopper trust.    

- **How do you anticipate your technology changing over time?** If you expect your technology to evolve in ways that require additional disclosure or consent, consider how your current disclosure strategy might provide a foundation for those changes, to avoid surprising shoppers.

## When and where to disclose  

For a low-sensitivity scenario, we recommend an **FAQ on your website** as the primary point of disclosure. An online FAQ lets shoppers review the information whenever they choose and lets you answer shoppers’ questions and concerns in adequate detail to build understanding. 

FAQ content can also be shared in a printed brochure available in stores. This makes the content accessible to people who may have limited internet access, and can help store associates be prepared to answer shopper questions.

Examples and tips for structuring an FAQ are included below.  

Additionally, you may consider different ways of raising awareness among shoppers that certain technologies are in use and how they can learn more. Think about where shoppers are most likely to expect to get information from your company based on existing communication patterns, such as:

- Locating the FAQ in a place on your website that's easily discoverable

- Including a link to the FAQ in other communication materials

Again, if your store uses other technologies that may require additional notice and consent, your disclosure strategy will incorporate additional touchpoints.   

## Design tips and examples

These recommendations are based on Microsoft research studies conducted on Dynamics 365 Connected Store disclosure materials. Visual examples are for explanatory purposes only and should be adapted to your unique context.

### Example: FAQ

|Tip|Why?|
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|✔ **DO** refer to  the **What to disclose** section of this article when deciding what information to include|Shoppers tend to have a common set of questions and concerns about how personal data is used and protected.|
|✔ **DO** consider introducing a concept such as “learning store” |Our studies show that a clear description of a “learning store” (for example, a store that uses insights to “learn” how to provide better customer service) helps shoppers understand the technology as a whole. |  
|✔ **DO** consider the local context|Some terms or concepts may have different cultural or language connotations in your local area.|
|✔ **DO** offer a way to learn more|Shoppers appreciate being able to ask additional questions, for example through email or a phone number.|
|![Red "X"](media/avoid.PNG "Red X") **AVOID** “you” or “your” (for example, “your shopping experience” or “your data”)|Use of “you” and “your” increases concern about personalization and personal data in this scenario.| 

### Example: Explaining what technology is in use and how it works
                
![Screenshot of an example answer on an FAQ webpage, with a graphic illustrating how the technology works, a short text explanation of the technology, and a graphic showing how technology insights are translated into customer outcomes](media/disclosure-example.PNG "Screenshot of an example answer on an FAQ webpage, with a graphic illustrating how the technology works, a short text explanation of the technology, and a graphic showing how technology insights are translated into customer outcomes")

|Tip|Why?|
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|✔ **DO** explain how insights are used to improve customer service|If you’re able to provide a clear value proposition to shoppers, they will understand the concept of insights better when they can see clearly how insights translate to their experience.|
|✔ **DO** use graphics to help explain unfamiliar concepts|Text is not sufficient to build understanding of less-familiar concepts such as anonymization and aggregation.|
|✔ **DO** differentiate between “video footage” and “insights” |Outlining the difference between “video footage” (which in Dynamics 365 Connected Store is not accessible by humans and is not stored) and “insights” (which are visible to humans and are stored) helps customers understand how data is protected.|
|![Red "X"](media/avoid.PNG "Red X") **AVOID** technical terms such as “AI,” “data,” and  “the cloud”|Technical terms can be difficult for shoppers to understand and may trigger discomfort or concern. Also, when a term is more abstract, shoppers may tend to assume the worst (for example, “data” means “my data”). | 

### Example: Explaining what information might be shared with other companies

![Screenshot of a second example answer on an FAQ webpage, with text and a visual outlining what information a store does or does not share with other companies](media/what-to-share-example.PNG "Screenshot of a second example answer on an FAQ webpage, with text and a visual outlining what information a store does or does not share with other companies")    

|Tip|Why?|
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|✔ **DO** clearly state whether personally identifiable information is stored|Shoppers’ primary concern around data privacy is the collection of personally identifiable information without their consent.|
|✔ **DO** provide examples of what you do and do not do with information|Especially when it comes to topics of higher privacy concern, shoppers show better understanding when examples are highlighted.|
|![Red "X"](media/avoid.PNG "Red X") **AVOID** words that suggest no changes will be made in the future (for example, “never”) |Shoppers may find terms like “never” or “not ever” unrealistic or dishonest.|
