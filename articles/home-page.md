# Get started with the Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview web app

The Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview web app [works together with the Azure Stack Edge gateway, networked cameras, and the Azure Cloud Service](how-cs-works.md) to provide you with insights on your connected store or space. You can use the web app to:

- [Connect cameras to your Azure Stack Edge gateway](cameras-connect.md)

- [Add skills to collect data](cameras-add-skills.md)

- [Set up alerts]()

- [Get insights on your store](web-app-get-insights.md)

- [Set store operating hours or access other store settings](web-app-set-operating-hours.md)

The web app Home page provides links for all of the above tasks, which makes it easy to get started.
