# Compliance and responsible use for Dynamics 365 Connected Store Preview

> [!NOTE]
> This article is provided for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. We strongly recommend seeking specialist legal advice when implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store. 

Dynamics 365 Connected Store Preview was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind, but some responsibilities are fully within our customers’ control. It is your responsibility to:

- Install and position cameras in your retail locations, and in doing so take care to avoid sensitive areas or locations that point to public spaces outside your store(s) such as streets or mall concourses and to limit collection of data not needed by Dynamics 365 Connected Store; 

- Inform people in your retail locations with conspicuous notices about video recording and use of AI (taking note that in some jurisdictions simply placing conspicuous notices may be insufficient);

- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction when using Dynamics 365 Connected Store; 

- Use Dynamics 365 Connected Store in a way that does not violate the rights of others or that may be harmful to others

Before using Dynamics 365 Connected Store, you must have all the proper rights to record and process video footage, including, where required, a lawful basis for recording and processing images of those individuals to generate insights, which in some jurisdictions may include obtaining their direct consent for that processing. Each of Microsoft’s customers has a different environment and clientele, so the particular method of notice or obtaining consent (where required) should be informed by any legal requirements applicable to you and your understanding of your own customers’ expectations.

Microsoft is committed to six core principles for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability. The principles are described at [Responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?rtc=1&activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr6). 

Consistent with these responsible AI principles, you should communicate with your customers about the purposes, strengths and limitations, and intended uses of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store.
