# Compliance and Responsible Use

Connected Store was designed with compliance, privacy, security, and confidentiality in mind, but some responsibilities are fully within our customers’ control. 
It is your responsibility to:

- Install and position cameras in your retail locations, and in doing so take care to avoid sensitive areas and limit collection of data not needed by Dynamics 365 
Connected Store; 

- Inform your customers with conspicuous notices about use of video data and use of AI;

- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction when using Dynamics 365 Connected Store; 

- Use Dynamics 365 Connected Store in a way that does not violate the rights of others or that may be harmful to others

Before using Dynamics 365 Connected Store, you must have all the proper rights to use your cameras and video images, including, where required, the necessary consent from 
individuals for the use of processing images to generate insights.  Each of Microsoft’s customers has a different environment and clientele, so the particular method of 
notice you choose to post in your store should be informed by any legal requirements applicable to you and your understanding of your own customers’ expectations.

Microsoft is committed to six core principles for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, 
inclusiveness, transparency and accountability. The principles are described here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai). 
Consistent with these responsible AI principles, you should be transparent with your customers about the use and purpose of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store.
