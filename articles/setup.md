# Set up Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

After you've [signed up for a free trial](trial-signup.md) and selected the **Launch Trial** button, you can set up Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview by using this procedure. 

1. You'll see the Connected Spaces logo and a progress bar at the bottom of the screen, and then the Welcome page will appear. 

2. On the Welcome page, select **Get started**.

3. On the next page, look for a message in the upper-left corner of the page. If the message says "Setting up your account for Connected Spaces," wait until the account setup is finished. If the account setup is finished, go to the next step.

6. On the **Gateways** page, do one of the following:

    - If you haven't already installed a gateway, and you want to order an Azure Stack Edge gateway, select **Order the ASE device from the Azure Edge Hardware Center**. Return to this page after ordering and/or installing the gateway. A gateway must be installed to use Connected Spaces.  
    - If you have already installed a gateway, or if you haven't already installed a gateway but you plan to install the gateway later, select **Next** to continue with the Connected Spaces setup.
