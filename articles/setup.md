6. On the **Gateways** page, do one of the following:

    - If you haven't already installed a gateway, and you want to order an Azure Stack Edge gateway, select **Order gateways on Azure Portal**. Return to this page after ordering and/or installing the gateway. A gateway must be installed to use Connected Spaces.  
    - If you have already installed a gateway, or if you haven't already installed a gateway but you plan to install the gateway later, select **Next** to continue with the Connected Spaces setup.
