When it comes to the use of cameras in retail settings, employees have many of the same questions and concerns as shoppers about what data is collected and how it's used. 
Employees also have additional concerns about how the technology will affect their day-to-day work and whether cameras may be used to monitor their performance. 

To uphold human dignity, build trust, and align with the standards set out in Microsoft’s [Responsible AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai), 
we suggest creating an employee disclosure strategy or expanding an existing strategy, such as how you [communicate with shoppers](communication-plan.md). Our research suggests that employees who 
understand and trust the technology will be in a better position to use the system effectively and also help shoppers reach the same level of trust and understanding.

The practices in this article can help you decide what information to share with employees as well as how to communicate that information. We arrived at these practices through several rounds of research conducted in a U.S. retail environment, including interviews with 8 store managers and evaluations of sample disclosure materials with 10 employees. Participants were balanced across a variety of ages, gender identities, ancestral backgrounds, store type, size of store, and their position within the store. We also offer tips for designing disclosure materials with the goal of making information easy to discover and understand.
Based on our research, we’re sharing practices that we’ve found successful in building shopper trust through transparency, but they may not be sufficient to comply with all laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to create a disclosure strategy that:
•	Works within the context of your store and your scenario.
•	Accurately reflects all of your data collection and processing practices, including those outside of Dynamics 365 Connected Store.
•	Complies with all laws and regulations that apply to your use case and in your geographic location, including specific requirements related to notice, disclosure, and consent. Microsoft cannot be held liable for your failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
