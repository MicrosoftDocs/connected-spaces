# Prepare user accounts for the Dynamics 365 Connected Store

To add additional users to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store, you must first assign the Dynamics 365 Connected Store Public Preview license to a new or existing 
user in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Then you'll configure the roles that the users will have access to (**Connected Store Admin** or **Connected Store Viewer**).

## Create new user accounts with the Microsoft 365 portal

1. Open the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

2. In the left pane, select **Users**, and then select **Active users**.

3. On the **Active users** page, select **Add a user**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, a password is automatically generated for new user accounts. Users must change this password the first time that they sign in by using their new account. 
    If you want to set a permanent password instead of using an automatically generated password, select the **Let me create the password** option and clear the **Require this 
    user to change their password when they first sign in** check box.
    
5. On the **Assign product licenses** page, select the location for the user, and then, under **Licenses**, select the **Dynamics 365 Connected Store Public Preview** check box. 
When you've finished, select **Next**.
