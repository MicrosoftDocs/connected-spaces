# Connect a camera to a gateway with the Dynamics 365 Connected Store mobile app

After you've paired a gateway to your store in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store, you can connect your cameras to the gateway. To add a camera, you must first select the gateway that the camera is connected to. You can connect any camera on the same network as your gateway.

Before connecting a camera to the gateway, you need to install it in the store if you haven't already. For more information, see: 

- [Plan camera placement](camera-placement-checklist.md)

- [Install your cameras](install-cameras.md)

More about cameras
Earlier in this guide, we showed how to add a camera to a gateway. This section describes other actions you can do with cameras.
Keep in mind that cameras are connected to a specific gateway. You won’t be able to find or add a camera if it isn’t available on the gateway network. If your store has multiple gateways you’ll need to access them one by one to see all the connected or available cameras. For more information, or for troubleshooting, see the Camera Installation guide.   
You can pair up to 10 cameras per gateway. If you need more cameras for your store, contact your account manager to request an additional gateway.
