# Security

Security of customer data is a shared responsibility. 

Microsoft, in providing Dynamics 365 Connected Store Cloud service, has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect customer data in its cloud. While the Connected Store service is still in a preview phase those security measures may differ from controls in place for Microsoft commercial cloud offerings.  To learn more about Microsoftâ€™s security practice, please visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center). 

You are responsible for securing equipment located on your retail premises and maintaining and securing your network and video feed from your cameras.
