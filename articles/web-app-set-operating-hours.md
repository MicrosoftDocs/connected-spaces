# Set your store's operating hours in Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview)

You can use the web app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store (public preview) to set your store's operating hours. If you don't set your operating hours, by default, the Connected Store dashboards will include after-hours data (when your store is being cleaned and restocked).

1. In the web app, select the appropriate store from the list at the top of the screen.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Settings**.

3. On the **Store** tab, in the **Operating Hours** field, enter your hours of operation.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Any changes you make to settings for the Contoso Sample Store will affect settings for other stores. For this reason, we don't recommend changing the settings for the sample store.
