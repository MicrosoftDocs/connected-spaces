    This step can take from 5-30 minutes. You’ll see a progress indicator showing where you are in the installation process. During this time, setup:
    
    - Creates a Microsoft Power Platform default environment for your Azure Active Directory tenant
    
    - Creates a Common Data Service instance and sets up a database
    
    - Installs the Connected Store solutions in the environment

    If this happens, try installing again.
    
3. While Connected Store is being installed, you can watch a demo and learn more about preparing for Connected Store by selecting **Welcome to Connected Store**.
