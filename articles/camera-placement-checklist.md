# Checklist for placing and installing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

> [!NOTE]
> The suggestions in this article are provided for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice. We strongly recommend seeking specialist legal advice when implementing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces. [Seeâ€¯Compliance and responsible use](compliance.md).

Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview can use new or existing Loss Prevention (LP) cameras installed within your space to process customer actions as customers move and interact within your space.

When determining where to place your cameras, we suggest using this checklist:

1. [Understand the scenarios](camera-placement-general.md) and your customer insight goals. The three scenarios for the preview release are Area, Queue, and Entries.

2. Select up to seven locations for the cameras (based on the previously listed scenarios and insight goals), and mark them on your site floorplan.

3. [Review the general placement guidelines and determine camera placement details for the different zones, including height, angle, and focal-point distance from the target](camera-placement-recommendations.md).

4. Install new cameras or use existing cameras supported by Connected Spaces Preview. Connected Spaces Preview supports standard IP cameras that: 

    - Can provide a Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) stream 

    - Use the H.264 or M-JPEG codec standard 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're using a fisheye or panoramic-type camera, the camera must have on-camera dewarping capabilities. 
    > Connected Spaces Preview supports a variety of cameras, including Axis, Bosch, and Sony. Validated camera models include Axis M5075 PTZ, Axis M3065-V, Axis M5065, Axis P3324-V Mk II, and Axis P3325-V Mk II. Most Connected Spaces Preview customers are able to use their existing security cameras. 

4. Comply with legal requirements applicable in your jurisdiction, which may include laws and regulations relating to use and placement of cameras and video technology, monitoring employees or public spaces, and notice and consent requirements. Take care to avoid sensitive areas and limit collection of data not needed by Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces ([see Compliance and responsible use](compliance.md)).
