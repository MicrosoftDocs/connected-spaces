# Checklist for placing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store

Dynamics 365 Connected Store requires Loss Prevention (LP) cameras installed within your space to process customer actions as they 
move and interact within your store.

When determining where to place your cameras, we recommend working through this checklist:

1.	[Understand scenarios](camera-placement-general.md) and your customer insight goals.

2.	Select up to 10 locations for the cameras (focused on the display effectiveness, queue analysis, and store traffic zones) and mark them on your site floorplan.

3.	[Review the general placement guidelines](camera-placement-general.md).

4.	[Review height, angle, and focus-point recommendations](camera-placement-recommendations.md) to determine camera placement details for the specified locations.

5.	[Determine the installation locations](camera-placement-recommendations.md) (height and distance from target) for each camera to help prepare for installation and cable routing.
