# Checklist for placing and installing cameras for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Store Preview

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store Preview requires Loss Prevention (LP) cameras installed within your retail space to process customer actions as customers move and interact within your store.

When determining where to place your cameras, we recommend using this checklist:

1. [Understand the scenarios](camera-placement-general.md) and your customer insight goals. The three scenarios for the preview release are Display effectiveness, Queue management, and Shopper analytics.

2. Select up to 10 locations for the cameras (based on the previously listed scenarios and insight goals), and mark them on your site floorplan.

3. [Review the general placement guidelines and determine camera placement details for the different zones, including height, angle, and focal-point distance from the target](camera-placement-recommendations.md).
