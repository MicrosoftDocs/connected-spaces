# Connect Azure Stack Edge Pro (2 GPU) to your network for use with Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview

[!INCLUDE[banner](includes/banner.md)]

After you've [installed Azure Stack Edge Pro (2 GPU)](ase-install.md), you're ready to connect it to your network and configure the network for use with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview. If you're working with a system integrator to install the hardware and set up the network, you might want to contact them for support with this step. 

## Initial setups and checks

1. Follow [the Windows Remote Management instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winrm/installation-and-configuration-for-windows-remote-management#quick-default-configuration) to install Windows Remote Management in your environment.

2. Pull the following files from this storage account (will need to update as the account hasnâ€™t been created yet):

    ase_up_customer.ps1<br>
    ase_up_customer_utility.ps1<br>
    device_settings.json

3. Fill in the values in the device_settings.json file.
