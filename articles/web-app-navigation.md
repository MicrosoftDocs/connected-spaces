|Button|Item|Description|
|-----|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
||Home|Selecting this button will take you to the **Analytics** page.<br><br>**Important:** This is not the preferred method of returning to the **Analytics** page. If you have more than one store you're monitoring, the app will reset to the store that is at the top of the list in the drop-down menu. Any changes made to the date picker will also be reset to the default. The preferred method of returning to the **Analytics** page is to use the breadcrumbs at the top of the page. Using this method will preserve your view preferences .|
||Recent|This shows you the history of the pages you have most recently visited.|
||Pinned|You can pin items from the list of most rently visited pages to access them more quickly.|
