# Use the Dynamics 365 Connected Store web app to get insights on your store

Dynamics 365 Connected Store serves as a platform to view, explore, and act on the diversity of data captured in your retail store. This article describes how to get insights from your store using the web app. 

Connected Store supports the following camera skills: 

- Shopper analytics

- Display effectiveness

- Queue management [Coming soon]. 
 
For a quick overview of how to get insights using the web app, scan the screens in this article. For a more thorough understanding, read through each section and experiment!

## Analytics page

After entering your credentials, you’ll see the Analytics page. This page provides a sense of the store’s overall performance across the skill-configured zones. 

The page includes a banner at the top that highlights key takeaways from all skill-configured zones. Below the banner, the page displays two visualizations per skill that illustrate general trends for those skills.

By default, the **Analytics** page shows the last 30 days, but you can select a custom date range or choose from other pre-selected ranges by using the date picker in the upper-right corner of the page.

The subscript describes the percent change in this value for the current time frame compared to the previous time frame of equal duration. The triangle to the left of the subscript indicates whether the change was positive or negative. 

>[!NOTE]
> If there’s insufficient data to draw a comparison, no information is displayed in the subscript area. This is true for all cards in the highlights banner.

**Busiest day.** This card highlights the day and date within the selected time frame that had the greatest number of people, along with the people count. 

SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE

The subscript describes the absolute change in this value for the current time frame compared to average footfall across all displays during the selected time frame. The triangle to the left of the subscript indicates how much greater footfall for the highlighted day was compared to the daily average footfall during the selected time frame. 

**Busiest display.** This card highlights the name of the display that had the greatest number of people during the selected timeframe, along with the people count.

> [!NOTE]
> Because there are several factors that can contribute to a change in value (for example, the number of displays in the store or a change in display configuration), the application does not include a comparison subscript.

**Most engaging display.** This card highlights the name of the display where people dwelled longer on average, along with the corresponding value. 

SCREEN SHOT GOES HERE

The subscript describes the absolute change in this value for the current time frame compared to average dwell time for all displays during the selected time frame. The triangle to the left of the subscript indicates whether this change was positive or negative. 

**Longest queue.** This card highlights the queue that was occupied by the most number of people across all queues for the selected time frame, along with the name of the queue and the date on which the value was observed.

**Slowest queue.** This card highlights the maximum wait (dwell) time for a queue across all queues for a selected time frame, along with the name of the queue and the date on which the value was observed.

The subscript describes the absolute change in this value for the current time frame compared to average wait (dwell) time across all queues during the selected time frame. The triangle to the left of the subscript indicates whether the change was positive or negative.
