## Analytics page overview

The **Analytics** page, which is organized by skill (Shopper analytics, Queue management, and Display effectiveness), provides a sense of the store’s overall performance for configured skills. Each skill type has small cards on the left that highlight key takeaways for the configured skill and graphs on the right for each skill instance.

## Filter by date

By default, the **Analytics** page shows the last 7 days, but you can select a custom date range or choose from other pre-selected ranges by using the **Date** filter.
