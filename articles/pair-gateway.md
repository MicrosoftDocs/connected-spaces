# Pair a gateway with the Dynamics 365 Connected Store mobile app

1.	In the mobile app, on the Stores page, tap the store you just added in the Stores list. This opens the Gateways page. 
 
4.	Tap the + sign at the bottom of the page.
5.	Select the gateway you want to pair with, and then tap the Add button next to it. You’ll see the following message: 

“Go to aka.ms/ConnectedStore on your laptop and enter the following <security number> to get the activation key of your gateway.”

 

6.	Enter aka.ms/activategateway into your laptop web browser that’s connected to the gateway, and then select Sign in.
 
7.	Enter your Dynamics 365 Connected Store credentials.
 
8.	Enter the security number from the mobile app.
 
9.	Select the venue ID you created earlier in the mobile app, and then select Submit.
 
10.	When the activation key is ready, copy the key (use Copy to clipboard to copy the full key), paste it into the Activation key field in the Activate pane, and then select Activate.
 
The activation process can take from one to ten minutes. When the device is activated, a notification will appear on your laptop to inform you that activation is complete. The Dynamics 365 Connected Store modules will begin downloading on the gateway. This can take up to 60 minutes. You’ll see a notification in the mobile app when downloading is complete.
 
After Azure Stack Edge is connected, you can connect and configure the cameras as described in the next section of this guide.
