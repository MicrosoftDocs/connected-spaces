# Use the Command Center in the Dynamics 365 Connected Store web app to set up notifications when store maximum occupancy thresholds are exceeded

You can set the maximum occupancy threshold for a store in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connected Store mobile app. When you set the **Maximum occupancy** value, 
you'll see the following items on the [**Shopper Analytics Summary** page](shopper-analytics-summary-page.md):

- **Over capacity** card

- **Over capacity instances** graph

- **Footfall power hours** heatmap

You can use the Command Center if you want to also get an email notification of any violation of maximum occupancy thresholds. You do this by customizing a 
Power Automate flow template. After setting up the template, the designated user(s) will receive reminders at the frequency you set while the store occupancy 
remains above the maximum occupancy threshold.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must allow pop-ups in your browser to receive the email notifications (pop-up blockers must be disabled).

## Enable the Command Center

Not sure if we need this section. It would cover the tooltip that directs you to the Command Center.
