<!--This template provides the basic structure of a trial frequently asked questions page. The first part of this page contains app-specific questions and answers. The second half of the page contains platform-specific issues that are pulled from a shared include statement to avoid duplicating information.
For Project Beethoven, we are focusing on the following core principles:
- Keep the frequently asked questions page minimal and consistent with this template
- Link out to additional information where possible
- Reuse content on the FAQ page by using the platform include statement
