# Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview trial FAQ

## Sign-up

### What are the system requirements for the trial?

This app is a cloud-based service that doesn't require special software other than an up-to-date web browser, though some restrictions apply. For the best trial 
experience, avoid accessing the trial site in incognito mode. [Learn more about web application requirements](/power-platform/admin/web-application-requirements).

### How do I sign up for the trial without a Microsoft 365 tenant?

You must sign up using an Azure Active Directory email account. You can [create a free Azure Active Directory tenant](https://signup.azure.com).

### Can I sign up for multiple Dynamics 365 apps such as Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service?

Yes, you can. To view all available trials, [visit the trial hub page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/dynamics-365-free-trial). You can use the same email account 
to sign up for different trials. However, it is not possible to have multiple apps on the same trial site. Each trial will be on a different org and URL. The trial data wonâ€™t 
be shared across apps.

## Trial app

### I didn't receive the trial details email after signing up, what should I do?

When you sign up for the trial, you'll receive an email with the trial details. If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your spam folder. Alternatively, use the 
following steps to access your app:

1. Go to trial site and select **Try for free**.

2. Enter the email ID that you used to sign up for the trial. You'll be redirected to your trial app.

### How do I add more users to a trial?

To add users, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) using the trial admin account. Follow 
the [admin center guidance](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to add users up to the trial license limit. If the user you are adding already has a Microsoft 
365 account, assign them an appropriate security role in the trial org. For more information, 
see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).

### How many users can I add to my trial environment?

You can add an unlimited number of users to the trial environment.

### How do I reset the trial environment?

You can't reset the trial environment. However, you can wait for the trial period to end and then sign up again for a new trial.

## Trial expiration and extension

### Why did my trial expire before the end of the trial period?

The trial expires if there's no activity for 14 consecutive days. An email notification is sent to you after seven days of inactivity. Expired trials cannot be reactivated. 
However, you can start a new trial.

### How do I extend the trial?

You can extend the trial for another trial period in the admin center. For instructions, 
see [Extend your trial](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments#extend-a-trial-standard-environment). You can extend your trial once.
### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces is currently offered for Preview. When the product is released for general availability (GA), you'll be able to convert the trial to a paid license. 

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The trial duration is 180 days, and can include up to 25 cameras.

## Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces Preview-specific questions

### How do I start using the trial?

After you sign up for the trial and select the **Launch Trial** button, you can [set up Dynamics 365 Connected Store Preview](setup.md), and then you can start trying it out. To learn more, see the links in the [Trial signup](trial-signup.md) page.
